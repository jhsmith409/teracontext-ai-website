# Our Solutions

## Advanced Context Management Techniques

TeraContext.AI employs a sophisticated toolkit of techniques to make large language models work effectively with documents that exceed standard context windows. We don't rely on a single approach—we combine methods strategically based on your specific requirements.

## Core Technologies

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What It Does**
RAG breaks documents into manageable chunks, creates semantic embeddings, and retrieves only the most relevant sections when answering queries.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with distinct, separable sections
- Query patterns that target specific information
- Need for citation and source tracking
- Compliance and audit requirements

**Our Implementation**
- Advanced chunking (semantic + structural) to avoid splitting key contexts
- Multi-modal embeddings for text, tables, diagrams, and even legacy PDFs
- Hybrid search: Semantic similarity + keyword boosts for precision
- Full citation trails linking responses to exact pages/sources for audits

### GraphRAG

**What It Does**
GraphRAG constructs knowledge graphs from your documents, capturing entities, relationships, and hierarchies—enabling reasoning across interconnected information.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with complex cross-references
- Need to understand relationships between entities
- Multi-document analysis and synthesis
- Questions requiring inference across document sections

**Our Implementation**
- LLM-powered entity/relationship extraction with 95%+ accuracy
- Custom ontologies tailored to your domain (e.g., legal clauses, engineering interfaces)
- Efficient graph traversal to fit LLM windows while capturing connections
- Seamless RAG integration for retrieval + reasoning

### Multi-Layer Summarization (RAPTOR & Beyond)

**What It Does**
Hierarchical summarization builds multiple abstraction layers—from detailed content to high-level overviews—allowing navigation from general to specific.

**When We Use It**
- Documents requiring both overview and detail
- Exploratory analysis of unfamiliar content
- Progressive refinement of understanding
- Executive summaries with drill-down capability

**Our Implementation**
- RAPTOR core with extensions for multi-document sets
- Domain-tuned hierarchies (e.g., spec divisions for construction)
- Query-driven layer selection: Overviews for broad asks, details for specifics
- Detail preservation via entity linking across levels

### Adaptive Context Assembly

**What It Does**
Dynamic systems that learn from query patterns and optimize context delivery based on task requirements and document structure.

**When We Use It**
- Repeated queries against the same document set
- Evolving understanding of document contents
- Performance optimization for high-volume processing
- Custom workflows with specific information needs

**Our Implementation**
- Query pattern analysis and optimization
- Context window management and prioritization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed content
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

---

### Hybrid Approaches

**The Reality**
Real-world problems rarely fit neatly into a single technique. Our most powerful solutions combine multiple approaches:

**RAG + GraphRAG**: Fast semantic search enriched by graph relationships—ideal for cross-document queries in legal due diligence.

**Multi-Layer + RAG**: RAPTOR overviews for navigation, RAG drills for precision—perfect for construction spec reviews.

**Adaptive + Graph**: Query history informs traversal; e.g., prioritize common paths in systems engineering docs.

## Implementation Flexibility

We integrate with your stack for seamless large-context document processing:

**LLM Providers**: OpenAI (GPT series), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Cohere, Hugging Face open-source, or fine-tuned models.

**Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Milvus, Qdrant—optimized for hybrid search.

**Graph Databases**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Azure Cosmos DB, TigerGraph for relationship-heavy data.

**Deployment Options**: AWS/Azure/GCP cloud, on-premises, hybrid, or air-gapped for compliance (e.g., DoD standards).
