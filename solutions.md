# Our Solutions

## Advanced Context Management and Fine-Tuning Techniques

TeraContext.AI employs a sophisticated toolkit of techniques to make large language models work effectively with documents that exceed standard context windows. We don't rely on a single approach—we combine methods strategically based on your specific requirements.

## Core Technologies

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What It Does**
RAG breaks documents into manageable chunks, creates semantic embeddings, and retrieves only the most relevant sections when answering queries.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with distinct, separable sections
- Query patterns that target specific information
- Need for citation and source tracking
- Compliance and audit requirements

**Our Implementation**
- Advanced chunking (semantic + structural) to avoid splitting key contexts
- Multi-modal embeddings for text, tables, diagrams, and even legacy PDFs
- Hybrid search: Semantic similarity + keyword boosts for precision
- Full citation trails linking responses to exact pages/sources for audits

---

### GraphRAG

**What It Does**
GraphRAG constructs knowledge graphs from your documents, capturing entities, relationships, and hierarchies—enabling reasoning across interconnected information.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with complex cross-references
- Need to understand relationships between entities
- Multi-document analysis and synthesis
- Questions requiring inference across document sections

**Our Implementation**
- LLM-powered entity/relationship extraction with 95%+ accuracy
- Custom ontologies tailored to your domain (e.g., legal clauses, engineering interfaces)
- Efficient graph traversal to fit LLM windows while capturing connections
- Seamless RAG integration for retrieval + reasoning

### Multi-Layer Summarization ([RAPTOR](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.18059v1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} & Beyond)

**What It Does**
Hierarchical summarization builds multiple abstraction layers—from detailed content to high-level overviews—allowing navigation from general to specific.

**When We Use It**
- Documents requiring both overview and detail
- Exploratory analysis of unfamiliar content
- Progressive refinement of understanding
- Executive summaries with drill-down capability

**Our Implementation**
- RAPTOR core with extensions for multi-document sets
- Domain-tuned hierarchies (e.g., spec divisions for construction)
- Query-driven layer selection: Overviews for broad asks, details for specifics
- Detail preservation via entity linking across levels

---

### Hybrid Approaches

**The Reality**
Real-world problems rarely fit neatly into a single technique. Our most powerful solutions combine multiple approaches:

**RAG + GraphRAG**: Fast semantic search enriched by graph relationships—ideal for cross-document queries in legal due diligence.

**Multi-Layer + RAG**: RAPTOR overviews for navigation, RAG drills for precision—perfect for construction spec reviews.

**Semantic Search + Classic Keyword Search**: For longer context documents, semantic (vector) searches can miss key details which conventional search finds easily.
