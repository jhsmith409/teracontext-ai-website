# Our Solutions

## Advanced Context Management Techniques

TeraContext.AI employs a sophisticated toolkit of techniques to make large language models work effectively with documents that exceed standard context windows. We don't rely on a single approach—we combine methods strategically based on your specific requirements.

---

## Core Technologies

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What It Does**
RAG breaks documents into manageable chunks, creates semantic embeddings, and retrieves only the most relevant sections when answering queries.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with distinct, separable sections
- Query patterns that target specific information
- Need for citation and source tracking
- Compliance and audit requirements

**Our Implementation**
- Advanced chunking strategies that preserve context boundaries
- Multi-modal embeddings for text, tables, and diagrams
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword approaches
- Citation tracking back to source documents and page numbers

---

### GraphRAG

**What It Does**
GraphRAG constructs knowledge graphs from your documents, capturing entities, relationships, and hierarchies—enabling reasoning across interconnected information.

**When We Use It**
- Documents with complex cross-references
- Need to understand relationships between entities
- Multi-document analysis and synthesis
- Questions requiring inference across document sections

**Our Implementation**
- Automatic entity and relationship extraction
- Ontology development for domain-specific concepts
- Graph traversal algorithms optimized for LLM context
- Integration with RAG for hybrid retrieval

---

### Multi-Layer Summarization (RAPTOR & Beyond)

**What It Does**
Hierarchical summarization builds multiple abstraction layers—from detailed content to high-level overviews—allowing navigation from general to specific.

**When We Use It**
- Documents requiring both overview and detail
- Exploratory analysis of unfamiliar content
- Progressive refinement of understanding
- Executive summaries with drill-down capability

**Our Implementation**
- RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)
- Custom hierarchical structures for domain-specific documents
- Adaptive layer selection based on query complexity
- Preservation of critical details at all abstraction levels

---

### Adaptive Context Assembly

**What It Does**
Dynamic systems that learn from query patterns and optimize context delivery based on task requirements and document structure.

**When We Use It**
- Repeated queries against the same document set
- Evolving understanding of document contents
- Performance optimization for high-volume processing
- Custom workflows with specific information needs

**Our Implementation**
- Query pattern analysis and optimization
- Context window management and prioritization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed content
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

---

### Hybrid Approaches

**The Reality**
Real-world problems rarely fit neatly into a single technique. Our most powerful solutions combine multiple approaches:

**RAG + GraphRAG**
Semantic retrieval enhanced with relationship understanding—finding not just relevant passages but related concepts across documents.

**Multi-Layer + RAG**
Hierarchical summarization for document overview, with RAG providing detailed retrieval when needed.

**Adaptive + Graph**
Learning systems that optimize graph traversal patterns based on query history and success metrics.
