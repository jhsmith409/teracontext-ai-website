# TeraContext.AI

> Mastering Context at Scale. Specialized AI solutions for working with massive, complex documents that exceed standard context windows. Expert implementation of RAG, GraphRAG, RAPTOR, and advanced context management techniques.

TeraContext.AI is a specialized division of Joshua8.AI focused on large-context document processing for enterprise applications. We solve the challenge of working with documents that overwhelm standard LLM context windowsâ€”from 5,000-page legal transactions to 15-volume construction specs to 10,000-page systems engineering requirements. Based in McLean, VA, we serve legal, construction, systems engineering, and enterprise clients worldwide.

## About

- [About Us](https://teracontext.ai/about): Our mission to make massive documents AI-accessible through intelligent context management, retrieval-augmented generation, and hierarchical processing techniques.
- [Why TeraContext.AI](https://teracontext.ai/#why-teracontextai): Part of the Joshua8.AI product line, combining deep LLM expertise with production-proven context management and industry-specific solutions.

## Solutions

- [Our Solutions](https://teracontext.ai/solutions): Advanced context management and fine-tuning techniques including RAG, GraphRAG, multi-layer summarization (RAPTOR), adaptive context assembly, and hybrid approaches for optimal results.
- [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://teracontext.ai/solutions#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag): Semantic chunking, multi-modal embeddings, hybrid search, and full citation trails for documents with distinct sections and compliance requirements.
- [GraphRAG](https://teracontext.ai/solutions#graphrag): Knowledge graph-based context organization for documents with complex cross-references, capturing entities, relationships, and hierarchies with custom domain ontologies.
- [Multi-Layer Summarization (RAPTOR)](https://teracontext.ai/solutions#multi-layer-summarization-raptor): Hierarchical document understanding with recursive abstractive processing for queries requiring broad contextual awareness.

## Use Cases
