## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a context window?
A context window is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a large language model can process in a single interaction. Modern LLMs have context windows ranging from 4K tokens (early GPT-3) to 32K, 128K, 200K, and even 1M-10M+ tokens in the latest models. However, real-world enterprise documents often exceed even these limits.

### Why can't I just use a model with a larger context window?
While larger context windows help, they face practical limitations:
- **Cost**: Processing costs scale with context length (10-100x more for 1M token windows)
- **Latency**: Larger contexts take longer to process (30+ seconds vs. 2 seconds)
- **VRAM Requirements**: Longer contexts require exponentially more GPU memory
- **Quality Degradation**: "Lost in the middle" problem where models struggle with very long inputs
- **Document Size**: Many enterprise document sets still exceed even 1M tokens

### What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG allows LLMs to work with information beyond their context window limits by retrieving only relevant chunks when needed. Process: document chunking → embedding → indexing → retrieval → generation. Benefits include working with documents of any size, fast performance, cost-effectiveness, and efficient context window usage.

### What is GraphRAG?
GraphRAG extends traditional RAG by building a knowledge graph that captures relationships between concepts, entities, and document sections. Unlike traditional RAG which retrieves chunks based on semantic similarity, GraphRAG understands how concepts connect and retrieves related information through the knowledge graph.

### What is multi-layer summarization (RAPTOR)?
RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval) builds a hierarchical understanding of documents through multiple layers of summarization: base layer (original chunks) → Level 1 (summaries of clusters) → Level 2 (summaries of summaries) → Top level (document overview). This enables both broad contextual queries and specific detail retrieval.

### What VRAM is needed for large-context processing?
Full context processing: 32K context requires 24-40GB, 128K requires 80-150GB, 1M requires 400GB+ (multiple GPUs). RAG/GraphRAG approaches: 8-16GB for embeddings, 16-24GB for inference, works with documents of any size. Most enterprise applications benefit from RAG-based approaches for better performance/cost/hardware balance.

### When should I use RAG vs. GraphRAG vs. RAPTOR?
- **RAG**: Best for question-answering, fact-finding, compliance checks, targeted searches in documents with distinct sections
- **GraphRAG**: Best for complex reasoning across sections, understanding relationships, regulatory compliance with interconnected requirements, systems engineering with dependencies
- **RAPTOR**: Best for queries requiring broad contextual awareness, executive summaries with drill-down capability, multi-document synthesis, hierarchical understanding
- **Hybrid**: Many applications benefit from combining approaches based on query type and document characteristics
