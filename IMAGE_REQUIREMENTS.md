# TeraContext.AI Website - Image Requirements

## Overview
This document specifies images needed for the TeraContext.AI website. All images should maintain a professional, modern, technology-focused aesthetic with emphasis on data, documents, and AI themes.

**Color Palette Guidelines:**
- Primary: Deep blues, teals (suggesting technology and trust)
- Secondary: Warm oranges/ambers (suggesting intelligence and energy)
- Accents: White, light grays
- Avoid: Overly bright/garish colors, cartoonish styles

**Style:** Clean, modern, professional. Mix of abstract/conceptual and concrete/literal. Avoid overly corporate stock photo aesthetics.

## Notes for Image Generation/Creation

1. **Consistency**: Maintain visual consistency across all images—use similar color palettes, styles, and design language
2. **Text Space**: Ensure key images have space for text overlays without obscuring important visual elements
3. **Responsiveness**: Consider how images will scale on mobile devices
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast for any text on images
5. **File Formats**:
   - JPG for photographs and complex images
   - PNG for images requiring transparency
   - SVG for logos, icons, and diagrams (when possible)
6. **Optimization**: Compress images for web without significant quality loss
7. **Alt Text**: Prepare descriptive alt text for each image (for accessibility)

## Suggested Tools/Services

- **AI Generation**: Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion for conceptual images
- **Diagrams**: Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Lucidchart for technical diagrams
- **Icons**: Noun Project, Flaticon, or custom creation in Illustrator
- **Photography**: Unsplash, Pexels for base images that can be edited/enhanced
